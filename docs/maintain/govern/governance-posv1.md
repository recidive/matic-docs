## Definitions

### Hardfork

A hardfork happens when the node software changes, so the new version is no longer
backward-compatible with earlier blocks. This is usually the result of a change in the consensus
calculation, meaning that blocks validated using the new calculation will produce a different hash.

In the current style of change implementation, hardfork block numbers
are broadcasted by the Polygon team after an initial staggered rollout to the larger nodes. A block
number is selected before which all nodes in the network should have upgraded to the new
version. Nodes running the old version will stop working (will be disconnected from the canonical
chain after the hardfork block).

Should there be ⅓+1 staked MATIC in disagreement with the fork, two canonical chains will temporarily
form until the end of the current span. After this, Bor will stop producing blocks, and the chain will
halt until consensus is reached.

### Softfork

This type of change is backward-compatible with the pre-fork blocks. This protocol change does
not require nodes to upgrade before a deadline. Therefore multiple versions of the node software can
be running at once and be able to validate transactions.

### Rough Consensus

Defined as the 'dominant view' of a group as determined by the current consensus framework.
Without a vote that can carry out a synchronous update across the network, the 'dominant view.'
is defined by the node software used by each validator, weighted by its total stake.

In the case of the Polygon PoS chain, this is programmatically defined by ⅔+1 of total staked MATIC.

### Governance module

The Polygon PoS consensus engine (Heimdall) has an inbuilt governance module that can synchronously
carry consensus parameter changes across the network. Users can submit proposals to the module
along with a deposit containing the proposed changes. Each validator tallies votes cast by validators.
Once the defined voting parameters are met, each validator automatically updates itself
with the proposal data.

The current voting parameters (denominated in staked MATIC):

- Quorum: 33.4%
- Threshold: 50%
- Veto: 33.4%

A list of the changeable parameters by the Heimdall governance module is available [here](https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/blob/develop/auth/types/params.go).

### Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP)

The PIP process, as defined in PIP-1, outlined a preliminary approach for allowing the community
to put forward-protocol upgrades that improve the network.

This takes inspiration from the [PEP process](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/), which has become a standard used for open source
projects, including Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Due to the permissionless nature of governance on the Polygon PoS chain, ⅔+1 of the total stake can
change the network by simply updating their node software. This fact is also actual
for the Ethereum Beacon chain. However, no change is considered for inclusion unless a proposal
passes through the right track.

As a guiding rule, it is recommended that all changes originate from the Polygon community forum
in the form of a proposal written in line with PIP-1.
