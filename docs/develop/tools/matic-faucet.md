**Polygon Faucet** is a tool provided by **Polygon** and its ecosystem partners such as **Alchemy** and **Quicknode** that **allows you to obtain free MATIC tokens on the Mumbai Testnet** and get started with the Polygon network. **These test tokens enable you to work with Polygon features without having to spend actual MATIC tokens** on the Mainnet.

:::info

Tokens on Testnet networks like Mumbai and Goerli have no value as they are only used for testing purposes.
