When setting up a new sentry, validator, or full node server, it is recommended that you use a snapshot for faster syncing without having to sync over the network. Using snapshots will save you several days for both Heimdall and Bor.

## Heimdall Snapshot

First, you need to set up your node with **prerequisites** as per the node setup guide. Before you start services for Heimdall to sync, follow the steps below to use the snapshot:

1. Download the snapshot tar file of Heimdall on your VM by running the following command:

```
aria2c -x6 -s6  <snapshot_url>

// For example, this will download the snapshot of Heimdall:
aria2c -x6 -s6 https://matic-blockchain-snapshots.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/matic-mainnet/heimdall-snapshot-2022-11-08.tar.gz
```

2. To unpack the tar file in the Heimdall data directory, run the following command:
```
// You must ensure you are running this command before you start the Heimdall service on your node.
// If your Heimdall service has started, please stop the service and run the following command:
// Once unpacking is complete, you can start the Heimdall service again:
tar -xzvf <snapshot file> -C <HEIMDALL_DATA_DIRECTORY>

// If your Heimdall data directory is different,
// please replace the directory name in the command for starting the Heimdall service.
// When this command completes, you may delete the tar file to reclaim space.

// For example, this will unpack the tar file in the Heimdall Data directory:
tar -xzvf heimdall-snapshot-2021-11-08.tar.gz -C /var/lib/heimdall/data/
```

## Bor Snapshot

First, you need to set up your node with **prerequisites**, as per the node setup guide. Before you start services for Bor to sync, follow the steps below to use the snapshot:

1. Download the snapshot tar file of Bor on your VM by running the following command:
```
aria2c -x6 -s6  <snapshot_url>

// For example, this will download the snapshot of Heimdall:
aria2c -x6 -s6 https://matic-blockchain-snapshots.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/matic-mainnet/bor-fullnode-snapshot-2022-11-08.tar.gz
```

2. To unpack the tar file in the Bor Data directory, run the following command:

```
// You must ensure you are running this command before you start the Bor service on your node.
// If your Bor service has started, please stop the service and run the following command:
// Once unpacking is complete, you can start the Bor service again.

tar -xzvf <snapshot file> -C <BOR_DATA_DIRECTORY>

// If your bor data directory is different
// please replace the directory name in the command for starting the Bor service.
// When this command completes, you may delete the tar file to reclaim space.

// For example, this will unpack the tar file in the Bor data directory:
tar -xzvf bor-fullnode-snapshot-2022-11-08.tar.gz -C /var/lib/bor/data/bor/chaindata
```

:::note

The `aria2c` method is used for downloading snapshots faster.
There is an alternate way where the downloaded snapshots can be directly extracted without any intervention.

**Steps for that:** 


```bash title="For Heimdall"
wget -c https://matic-blockchain-snapshots.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/matic-mainnet/heimdall-snapshot-2022-11-30.tar.gz -O - | tar -xzf - -C ~/.heimdalld/data/
```

```bash title="For Bor"
wget -c     https://matic-blockchain-snapshots.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/matic-mainnet/bor-fullnode-snapshot-2022-11-21.tar.gz  -O - | tar -xzf - -C ~/.bor/data/bor/chaindata
```
