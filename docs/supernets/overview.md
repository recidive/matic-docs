:::caution Status

The Supernets documentation is a work in progress. Currently, this Hub only extends
the original **[Polygon Edge](../edge/overview.md)** documentation to provide material for
the functionality in the
**[v0.7.0-alpha release](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge/releases/tag/v0.7.0-alpha1)**.

**The code is undergoing an audit and should not yet be used in production environments.**
Please get in touch with the Polygon team if you would like to use it in production or have any questions.

## Introduction

Polygon Supernets are a customizable, modular, and extensible blockchain stack that
can be used to build highly robust and forward-compatible application-specific blockchains.

Supernets remove the complexity of blockchain development by providing premium support
to help you build your blockchain without the hassle of maintaining blockchain infrastructure.

It is built on top of [Polygon Edge](../edge/overview.md), a modular and extensible
framework for building Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, sidechains, and general scaling
solutions.

## Why Supernets?

When the Matic network first started, and later evolved into Polygon to capture a fleet of
next-generation scaling solutions for Ethereum, the success was a result of putting users
and developers first.

Supernets offer a plug-and-play approach to building blockchains from scratch and the
response from developers has been overwhelming. Supernets are appealing to developers because
it simplifies the complexity of Polygon Edge, and it allows developers to focus on their
use case without needing to worry about the overhead that comes with blockchain infrastructure
and bootstrapping.

All Supernets projects have access to Polygon's support and consultancy resources and proven
PoS validators. Supernets are the fast track for blockchain adoption in new private and public
networks for dApps and enterprises.

## The Supernet pillars

1. **Operational excellence**: focuses on creating continuous improvement standards
   and operational excellence. This includes establishing and maintaining a foundation
   for operational excellence.

2. **Security**: focuses on protecting data confidentiality, integrity,
   and availability.

3. **Reliability**: focuses on creating a highly available and resilient blockchain architecture
   that can withstand failures and disruptions.

4. **Performance efficiency**: focuses on optimizing resource use to improve applications'
   performance and reduce costs.

5. **Cost optimization**: focuses on reducing the cost of running blockchain in the cloud
   or on-premise without sacrificing performance or functionality.
